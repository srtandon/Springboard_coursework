    "If we assume that reimbursements costs were zero before the experiment is implemented than a simple rise in reimbursement costs would indicate success. However the problem is that a rise in reimbursement may be attributed the the drivers that already crossed the toll bridge before the experiment so this is not a good measure. \n",
    "If we look at the rise of tolls collected following the experiment and the ratio of reimbursements to rise in tolls then we get a better understanding of the effect of the experiment. We could also compare the number of tolls to the nightitme and daytime activity of each city. A paired t-test would be run to look at the total tolls collected before and after the experiment of was implemented. The would tell us if there was a significant increase in cross-city traffic. The significance level would depend on the total number of drivers of each city. A pearson correlation to look at level of activity compared to tolls collected before and after the experiment was implemented. This correclation testing would give us insight on whether tolls collected in either city during the other city's peak activity can be used as an indication of the experiement's success"
